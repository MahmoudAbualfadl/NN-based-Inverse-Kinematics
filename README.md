# NN-based-Inverse-Kinematics
# Neural Network-based Inverse Kinematics

## Overview
Inverse kinematics is a classic problem in robotics that involves determining the required joint angles for a robot to reach a specific position with its end-effector. This project uses a neural network to solve the inverse kinematics problem by treating it as a machine learning task, removing the need for complex mathematical modeling.

With deep learning, we are able to approximate the relationship between joint angles and end-effector positions without explicit mathematical equations. This approach leverages large datasets, neural networks, and optimization techniques to handle non-linear and complex relationships in inverse kinematics.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Generation**: We generate training and testing datasets using a forward kinematics function that computes end-effector positions from random joint angles.
2. **Model Building**: We construct a neural network to learn the mapping between (x, y) positions and joint angles (theta1, theta2).
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the generated dataset, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an evaluation metric.
4. **Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using test data, and training history is visualized to check for overfitting or underfitting.
5. **Prediction**: The trained model can predict joint angles for given end-effector positions, allowing for practical applications in robotic control.

## Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Takes two inputs, x and y, representing the target position of the end-effector.
- **Hidden Layers**: Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions, each followed by a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. These layers allow the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships.
- **Output Layer**: Produces two outputs, theta1 and theta2, which represent the joint angles.

## Training Details
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer, an adaptive algorithm that adjusts weights to minimize error.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual joint angles.
- **Metric**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is tracked to measure the average prediction error.
- **Epochs**: The model is trained over multiple epochs to allow it to learn from the data.
- **Validation**: A portion of the training data is set aside to evaluate model performance during training and detect overfitting.

## Results
### Training History
The following plots visualize the training and validation performance:
- **Model Loss**: Shows the MSE loss for training and validation over time. The loss decreases and stabilizes, indicating the model is learning effectively.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Shows the average prediction error for both training and validation. The low and consistent MAE indicates that the model’s predictions are close to actual joint angles.

### Observations
- The close alignment of training and validation curves suggests that the model generalizes well.
- Stabilization of loss and MAE values indicates convergence, meaning the model has learned the underlying pattern in the data.

### Next Steps
- **Increasing Epochs**: If the validation loss and MAE are still decreasing, additional epochs might further improve accuracy.
- **Adjusting Model Complexity**: If there’s significant fluctuation or overfitting, simplifying the model or increasing dropout may help.
